Please note the work here is released for your private pleasure only, as in non-comercial use, you can print as many locks as you want for yourself, your freinds, collegues, family whatever. Just don't start selling them for profit.

Disclaimer:
First off a warning... The lock described on this page, is never meant to be used in a real life situation, the plans is provided as is, as an example on how sush a device can be realized, so please do not use it to lock you self down, especially not unattended. Niether TheInstitute nor Helmetboy can be held responsible, for any injury that might arise from using the lock described on this page. You are entitely on your own, consider yourself warned.

But don't let that scare you, it's a fun project anyway. ;) Also please note that some of the spelling errors is intentional, not to upset any of the companies that produces similar products, and other spelling mishabs is entirely my fault.. :)

A while ago I designed a DIY button lock, as an alternative to the well established brands such as Seegufux, Heetbamb, Neocare etc. the plans is also published here on The Institute. Unfortunately I haven't heard that anyone actually have managed to make some working locks, using the plans.

A coupple of years ago, I finally got my self together and me build a 3D printer, and what better use for such a device, than printing kinky stuff in the privacy of your home.

The basic working principle of the lock is unchanged, but I had to make some adjustments to the design, to make it printable, you can't expect the same precision from a 3D printer as you can with traditional machining, especially not on a RepRap type 3d printer, using filament of more or less unknown origin and production standards. On the other hand, 3D printing gives a lot of other design possibilities, which would be dificult if not impossible to replicate using traditional machining methods.

One thing that bothered me with the old design, was the repeatability of the locking action, bending piano-wire manually introduces quite a lot of variation in spring tension, and thus feel of the lock when locking and unlocking. Therfore I have moved to a printed spring, this gives way smoother operation, and far more repeatability in the feel of the lock. However a printed spring has nowhere the tension as the bend piano wire. To counter this, a small slot has been introduced which helps keep the locking wires in place, when the lock is loaded. So the more you pull, the harder it locks, without this slot it was very easy to unlock the lock, by just pulling and twisting it. There is a minor drawback with this design, it can be difficult unlock the lock, when it's loaded, but that is nowhere different from other comercial available offerings, some is actually impossible to open when loaded. The intenal shape of the lock, does allow for the lock to be unlocked, while lightly loaded, but this depends on the locking wire to be long enough (this will make sense later on).

But still, A word of caution..! Make sure to test that the lock has space to unlock, with the intended numbers of belts before you lock something or someone down. If you are using the standard Seegufux belts and pins, you should be relatively safe, as the lock won't engage with more than 4 belts stacked, I don't have any of the other major brands to test with, and if you start mixing pins and belts from different brands, be sure to test it out. Afterall it is way easier to pick the lock with two paperclips on the desk, than in panic strapped to the bed, with your mother in law knocking on the door.
The introduction of a printed spring also means that you have to be a bit more carefull when applying glue to assemble the lock, as you risk gluing the spring. To counter this I have intoduced a spacer plate, that goes in the middle, this can be pressed down without glue and then sealed along the edges.

The lock has mostly been tested in ABS, but PLA should work just as well. I have sucessfully printed the lock with both a 0.5mm and a 0.35mm nozzle, in a wide varity of layer widths and heights. You need a fairly well calibrated printer, to get a good result, the parts shouldn't need much cleanup if any at all before assembly.
If you want nice finish, acetone vapor treatment works very well (google knows a lot about this), I have had the best results by treating the fully assembled locks, locked on a pin, with the keyholes plugged, for this 3mm PLA filament works fine. This of course only works with locks printed in ABS.
Springs works best when printed in ABS, as PLA springs tends to be more loose after a few uses, the lock still works fine, but it might rattle a bit when shaken. And despite slacky PLA springs, I haven't been able to pull the lock open. But if possible, print the springs in ABS, the rest of the lock can still be PLA.

Assembly of the key:
Start by printing the key, this will become handy when you test the lock, drill out the 2 holes in the key to 3mm. If you happens to use 3mm filament, it is possible to use this, which should be cut to approx 45 degrees in one end, dont glue them until you have the orientation and length right.
Instead of filament that tend to get brittle over time, the better option is to use some kind of 3mm metal rod, anything will go, be it brass, stainless, gold, or whatever you happen to have laying around. Bauhaus, eBay or you local hobby store normally stock this, together with the piano wire which you most likely need to buy also.
As for the wire, I have sucessfully used 1mm stainless wire instead of piano wire, so this is definately also an option, if you can't find piano wire.

Assembly of the lock:
Clean up the parts to make them fit well together, also clean up the surfaces where the springs is resting, cut 2 pieces of 1mm piano wire approx 18.5mm long. To make cutting easier, print the small piece of tube, and use it as a length guide. If you cut the wires too long, the lock won't be able to open properly, as the wires will hit the inner walls of the lock, if you cut them too short, the lock will not open, unless you press down on it while opening it, because the wires is pressed down into the slots by the key. It's also a good idea to smooth the ends of the wire with a file, this will make them less prone to get stuck in the inner walls of the lock. Insert the inner plate without glue, to test that everything works. When the lock operates smothly, seal the inner plate around the edges. For ABS locks, Acetone on a swap is formidable, just be carefull, not to get any acetone into the lock, for PLA I still need to find something that works just as good. If the plate is a tight fit, sealing probably isn't needed.

I found that the orientation of the top part of the lock, can influence the fit of the key-holes, so if the key binds a bit, try turning the top part 180 degrees. Of course this depends on the slicing of the parts, and how well tuned your printer is.
I use cyano glue, which should work fine on both ABS and PLA. Pushing the parts needs to be done quickly and precise, and try not to use too much glue, as it will leave marks on the outside of the lock. In the start the lock may be a little rough in the operation, but as you start using it, it will break in and operation will be smoother.

Modification of the pins.
Standard Seegufux pins without chamfering on the top works ok, it is possible to lock them without having to insert the key. But it really helps smoothing the operation, if you add some chamfer to the top. This is easily done with a file.

I have included stl files for different shapes of the shell, the middle part, top part and the springs is the same for all locks. Also all of the shapes except for the oval shape, is included for the new style Seegufux pins, the ones with green locks, name is suffixed with New.
